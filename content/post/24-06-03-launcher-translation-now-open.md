The launcher is now open for translation by YOU! Know a language that isn't English? You can help!

<!--more-->

We are now hosting a *Weblate* instance, so if you're interested in translating, you can! No knowledge of code or development software is required, all you need is a web browser, your Space Station 14 account, and maybe an open dictionary on the side.

For now, **only the launcher can be translated from Weblate**. While the main game has supported translation for years, it's something only other servers can make use of. Because we don't want people to contribute translations that are not going to be used, our current policy remains that we are not accepting translations for the main game ourselves.

If you are interested, we have a more formal documentation page [here](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/general-development/contributing-translations.html) with instructions.
